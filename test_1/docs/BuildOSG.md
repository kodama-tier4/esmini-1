The content previously available here has been replaced by:
1. Script that do all the work: https://github.com/esmini/esmini/blob/master/scripts/generate_osg_libs.sh

   It can also serve as documentation and starting point for building OSG for esmini.
1. Info on osgconv (convert 3D models) and how to get osgb models into Unity has been moved to the [User guide](https://esmini.github.io/index.html#_openscenegraph_and_3d_models).
